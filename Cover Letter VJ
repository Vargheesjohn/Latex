To whomsoever it may concern, \\

I would like to start off my justification with the above mentioned analogy i've come across on the internet a while back which I later figured was used by \textit{Peter De Vries} in \textit{Let Me Count the Ways}. Even though I never managed to read the book and get to know why and for what reason he used it, i must say I was so much inclined to the notion of the analogy. I was so interested and curious with it that I even sort of sorted the entire humanity based on it. On one side those who fool themselves and the rest of the world by pretending that they've found the combination and know all there is to know while on the other side lay those who struggle with the truth that we don't have even the slightest idea of things in the larger schemes nevertheless endeavors to find it out. \\

The task of the researcher also on some level i think is just the same as the group of endeavors we've seen above and it is a critical and significant trait for him i suppose. I think so because the researcher too like the people of the other side struggles himself with a problem for which he seeks to find a solution and experiences a sense of euphoria when he does finds it finally. And that is why i believe becoming a researcher would be the best fit for me for from my very childhood i was curious and have kept on wondering about how things work and tried to make sense out of such things as to why things are the way they are and even had a few euphoric moments upon understanding few of such things. In the near future I hope to sense many more of such euphoric moments and fulfill my yearnings for which, i think, this would be the perfect field. \\

To add on i happen to have also other reasons other than the aforementioned yearning and i should say they are rather manifolded. Unfolding some folds of the many folds, I used to and still do find myself constantly pondering over the applicability and practicality of those economic theories, mathematical derivations and such sort of things which I've been taught ever since I could remember studying and I must say I still couldn't quite convince myself over their ideology. So one of the many significant reasons would be to apply in real life whatever I've been learning and learnt from the books and understand their actual efficacy and practicality but, be that as it may, on the contrary I feel like i still have a lot to learn, to quote one of the astounding philosopher all time \textit{I know that i know nothing} and I believe this is the right place to learn them. Having these said I can can assure you that providing me with this opportunity wouldn't go to vain but will be a wise and worthwhile decision.

\end{document}

My motive in applying for this research assistant position, i would say, are manifold or atleast twofold if i am right in what i think about and of my self. so i shall mention those two THINGS alone of which i am atleast sure. Even though it seems like the motives are twofold nonetheless are they same for in some deep rooted sense they are intertwined into one. One might even say it is paradoxical for i see it to be both as an act of selfishness and altruism.
The first part of that fold might have come, which i believe to be the act of selfishness is, from my own nature to explore and experience new things and learn them which again i believe is one of the critical and significant trait for anyone to be a researcher irrespective the field of specialization. I hope that these will help me out in the large scheme of things and take me to a place where i would want to be.
